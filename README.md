# How to run
Currently, the installation of this application is very simple.
  - First fork / clone the repo to your local Java IDE (Preferrably Intellij)
  - Once you have access to all the files you can then simply run (main) the server first (This is done since client will terminate without a server connection available)
  - Then run the main method of the client file
  - You can now check your terminal at the bottom of your screen, you should see two terminals (Server, Client)
  - Once this is established you can simply type messages back and forth to Server & Client (String "Over" ends the process)
